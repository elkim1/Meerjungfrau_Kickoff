A hungry Bridget bought 10 Gebaeck to snack on during her daily walk. 
She was listening to Rammstein as she began her journey.
Walking to work in the city of Berlin.
Musik was her escape from the mundane hustle and bustle.  
She hopped in in her Audi R8 and down the autobahn she flew!
On her way, she passed a biergarten that reminded her of brot.
Her Klimaanlage was blasting to keep her cool and refreshed.
